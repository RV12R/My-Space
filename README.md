# [MY SPACE](http://skillful-example.surge.sh/)

[My space](http://skillful-example.surge.sh/) is my portfolio website built on top of [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), deployed with [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh/). Three.js is a cross-browser JavaScript library and application programming interface used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser using WebGL.

## Getting Started

First, install all required dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying with the help of these [documentations](https://threejs.org/docs/). The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
